# Predicting student final grade using machine learning

*This machine learning model is capable of predicting students final grades based on school attributes.*

## 1. Problem Definition
> The goal of this project is to create a predictive model that can forecast a student's final grade using features such as attendance, previous academic performance, socio-economic background, engagement in school activities, and other relevant attributes.

## 2. Data
The original data came from here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance

## 3. Evaluation
> If the model can reach 93% accuracy at predicting students final grade, we will persue the project.
